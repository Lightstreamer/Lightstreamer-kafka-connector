<!--
    This is a generic template for the configuration file of an Adapter Set
    pluggable into Lightstreamer Server.
    It can be considered a reference example of Proxy Adapters deploy.
    Note that element and attribute names are handled in a case sensitive way.

    A very simple variable-expansion feature is available; see
    <enable_expansion_for_adapters_config> in the Server's main configuration file.
-->

<!-- Mandatory. Define an Adapter Set and its unique ID. -->
<adapters_conf id="KafkaConnector">

    <!-- Mandatory. The Metadata Adapter is the Java Proxy Adapter. -->
    <metadata_provider>

        <!-- Mandatory. Java class name of the Proxy Metadata Adapter.
             In this case, "PROXY_FOR_REMOTE_ADAPTER" is a special keyword that
             identifies the Proxy Metadata Adapter, which is embedded
             in Lightstreamer Server and available out of the box.
             The Proxy Metadata Adapter communicates with its remote counterpart
             through standard TCP sockets. It listens on a configurable port
             and waits for its counterpart to connect. -->
        <adapter_class>com.lightstreamer.adapters.metadata.LiteralBasedProvider</adapter_class>

    <!-- Mandatory and cumulative. The Data Adapter is the Java Proxy Adapter.
         The "name" attribute is optional and the default name is "DEFAULT";
         if multiple Data Adapters are defined in the same Adapter Set,
         then using the "name" attribute is needed to distinguish them. -->
    <data_provider name="QuickStart">

        <!-- Mandatory. Java class name of the Robust Proxy Data Adapter.
             In this case, "ROBUST_PROXY_FOR_REMOTE_ADAPTER" is a special keyword that
             identifies the Robust Proxy Data Adapter, which is embedded
             in Lightstreamer Server and available out of the box.
             The Robust Proxy Data Adapter communicates with its remote counterpart
             through standard TCP sockets. It listens on a configurable port
             (or, optionally, two ports) and waits for its counterpart to connect.
             Moreover, this Data Adapter manages the case in which the remote
             counterpart is missing, by accepting subscriptions and sending empty
             snapshots to the clients, when requested (note that the clients
             should be able to manage null field values for items subscribed to
             in MERGE mode).
             This Data Adapter also manages failures of the remote counterpart,
             by waiting for connection from a new Remote Server, then trying
             to recover the data flow by resubmitting all the pending subscription
             requests. However, if the remote counterpart needs to retrieve and
             restore the state of the previously connected instance, this will be
             its own burden; for how to identify the involved Server instance,
             see "remote_params_prefix" below. -->
        <adapter_class>ROBUST_PROXY_FOR_REMOTE_ADAPTER</adapter_class>

        <!-- Mandatory for Proxy Adapters. Determines the ClassLoader to be used
             to load the Adapter related classes (see the base template).
             In case a Proxy Adapter is configured, it is advisable to use the
             special "log-enabled" option, to let the Proxy Adapter share the
             logging support and configuration with the Server.
             If set to "dedicated", logging support must be explicitly provided,
             by adding the slf4j library, together with a suitable log
             implementation and configuration. If an "install_dir" element
             is defined, it will be used also to this purpose.
             With this special configuration, the "common" option is forbidden. -->

        <!-- List of initialization parameters specific to the Proxy Data Adapter. -->

        <!-- Mandatory.
             The request/reply port to listen on. The connection on this port will
             carry the requests/replies channels.
             However, in case the configuration of "notify_port" has to be
             leveraged, the connection will only carry the pure-replies subpart
             of the replies channel. -->
        <param name="request_reply_port">6661</param>

        <!-- Optional.
             If Y, enforces Remote Adapter authentication on the connection
             based on a user/password credential check.
             In case of two-ports configuration, the same check is performed
             on both connections.
             Note that the user names will be used in log messages at INFO level
             or above, whereas the passwords won't.
             The configuration of the accepted credentials is shown below.
             Note that the various credential pairs should be distinguished
             from one another by adding a free dot-suffix to the base
             auth.credentials part.
             If N, the credential configuration parameters below are ignored.
             Default: N. -->
