  "description": "The Lightstreamer Kafka Connector is an intelligent proxy that bridges Kafka with web and mobile applications, ensuring real-time data streaming across the last mile. It addresses challenges like firewalls, unpredictable internet bandwidth, and large data volumes using Lightstreamerâ€™s advanced technology.\n\nBy eliminating the need for REST polling and MQTT proxies, it simplifies architecture while enhancing performance with features like Intelligent Streaming, adaptive throttling, server-side filtering, and powerful topic mapping.\n\nDesigned for massive scalability, Lightstreamer supports millions of concurrent clients with low latency. It efficiently fans out real-time messages from Kafka topics, minimizing the load on both the Kafka broker and the client applications.\n\nThe Lightstreamer Kafka Connector can be configured to work either as a Kafka Connect sink or a direct Kafka client.\n\nIt provides extensive client SDKs for developing applications for the web, mobile, desktop, and various smart devices.\n\n\n\nTags: last-mile, websockets, ws, http, apps, frontend, front end, front-end, javascript, html, android, ios, swift, broadcast, push, push notifications",
