# Lightstreamer Kafka Connector

## Distribution Contents
This directory contains the resources required to deploy the Lightstreamer Kafka Connector into a Lightstreamer Server instance:

- `adapters.xml`, the Lightstreamer Kafka Connector configuration file
- `log4j.properties`, the logging configuration file.
- `lib`, the directory containing all the library jar files.

Furthermore, you can add additional resources that the configuration file may requires, as the schema files for _Apache Avro_ and _JSON deserialization.
