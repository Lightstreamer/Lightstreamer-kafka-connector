# Lightstreamer Web Consumer for the Quick Start App

This directory contains the HTML and JavaScript files for a simple web application that consumes real-time stock data from a Kafka topic via the Lightstreamer Kafka Connector. It's designed to be used with the Lightstreamer Kafka Connector [_Quick Start_](../../README.md#quick-start-set-up-in-5-minutes) App.

Furthermore, you want to download this folder to test your Kafka Connector [installation](../../README.md#installation):

1. Start [publishing](../../README.md#3-publish-the-events) simulated market data.

2. Open the web/index.html file in your browser, and watch real-time updates populate the frontend immediately.
